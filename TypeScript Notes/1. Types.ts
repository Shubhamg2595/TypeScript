// ! Type
// Easy way to refer to different properties + functions that a value has
// types can be understood as labels for describing the different properties and methods that a single value has.

// ? 1. Primitive Types:
// * -number - boolean - undefined - null - string - symbol - null;

// ? Object Types:
// * -functions -arrays -objects -classes


// ? why we need types?
// - types are used by the TS compilers to analyze our code for errors.
// - types allow other engineers to understand what values are flowing around our codebase.

// ? we use types everywhere when working with typeScript
